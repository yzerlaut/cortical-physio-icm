# Calcium imaging


## Experimental procedure

- [imaging window targeting V1](../doc/drawing-window.png).
- ...

## Registration and Cell detection

Use [Suite2P](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p). 

Follow instructions in the documentation at [http://mouseland.github.io/suite2p](http://mouseland.github.io/suite2p)

## Preprocessing of Calcium signals
	
The preprocessing step are illustrated in the [demo notebook](https://github.com/yzerlaut/cortical-physio-icm/blob/master/Ca-imaging/preprocessing_demo.ipynb)

## Use Principal Component Analysis to find patterns of population activity

The use of PCA is shown in the [demo notebook](https://github.com/yzerlaut/cortical-physio-icm/blob/master/Ca-imaging/PCA_demo.ipynb)
