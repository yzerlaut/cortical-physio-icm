# FLIR camera

*control of FLIR camera*

## Installation

Install FLIR, Spinnaker SDK and the python API.
- https://www.flir.fr/products/spinnaker-sdk/

Install the simple API on top of the API:
- https://pypi.org/project/simple-pyspin/
**EDIT**, you might want to prefer my forked version to deal with the "pyspin" vs "PySpin" naming issue (see https://github.com/yzerlaut/simple_pyspin).


## Setting up the camera

Use the FlyCap software provided by *PT-Grey Camera* to set the acquisition frequency, gain, brightness, etc... that best suits the experiment.
